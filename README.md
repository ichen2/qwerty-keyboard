## qwerty-keyboard

A synth you can play using the qwerty keys.
Each of the keys corresponds to a note in the C major pentatonic scale.
It uses tone.js to render sound, and p5.js to render the visuals.

You can represent songs (without rhythm) using a string of chars 'q' through 'y'. 

For example, 'Mary Had A Little Lamb' is
'ewqweeewwwerrewqweeeewwewq'
