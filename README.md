## qwerty-keyboard

qwerty-keyboard is a synth you can play using the 'q', 'w', 'e', 'r', 't', and 'y' keys.
Each of the keys corresponds to a note in the C major pentatonic scale.
It uses tone.js to render sound, and p5.js to render the visuals.

You can represent songs (without rhythm) using a string of chars 'q' through 'y'. 
For example, 'Mary Had A Little Lamb' is 'ewqweeewwwerrewqweeeewwewq' (press those keys to the tune of the song)
